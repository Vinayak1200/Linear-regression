# Linear-regression

# About this repository :
This repository contains codes of many basic linear regression machine learning models.

# About Pima.ipynb
This code creates a linear regression model for predicting body mass index (BMI) from a given value of skin fold.
The dataset is contained in the pydataset module.

# About v-s-house-price model
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition  challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Practice Skills
Creative feature engineering 
Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting
